# Enhanced Review and Rating System

This implementation provides a complete review and rating system for the PaiNaiDee application as requested in Issue #26.

## Features Implemented ✅

### Core Review Functionality
- ✅ Users can add reviews with ratings (1-5 stars) and comments
- ✅ Users can view all reviews for any attraction with pagination
- ✅ Users can edit and delete only their own reviews
- ✅ Duplicate review prevention (one review per user per attraction)

### Rating System  
- ✅ 1-5 star rating scale with validation
- ✅ Average rating calculation for each attraction
- ✅ Total review count display
- ✅ Review statistics integrated into attraction details

### Security & Authorization
- ✅ JWT authentication required for write operations
- ✅ User can only modify their own reviews
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- ✅ Input validation and SQL injection protection

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | `/api/reviews` | Add new review | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/attractions/{id}/reviews` | Get paginated reviews for attraction | ❌ |
| PUT | `/api/reviews/{id}` | Update own review | ✅ |
| DELETE | `/api/reviews/{id}` | Delete own review | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/attractions/{id}` | Get attraction details (now includes review stats) | ❌ |

## Database Schema

The review system uses proper database relationships:

```sql
-- Enhanced Review table with user relationships
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    place_id INTEGER REFERENCES attractions(id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, place_id)  -- Prevents duplicate reviews
);
```

## Testing

All functionality is thoroughly tested with 49 passing tests including:
- Unit tests for review service logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Authorization and security tests
- Edge case and error handling tests

Run tests with: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
